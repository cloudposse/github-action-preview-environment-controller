# Short description of this project
description: Action to manage to deploy and purge preview environments depends on PR labels

introduction: |-
  Testing Pull Request changes usually lead to having it deployed on a preview environment.
  The environment can be ephemeral or pre-provisioned. In the last case, there is a countable number of preview environments.
  This GitHub Action follows a pattern when the developer set PR label to specify a preview environment to deploy.
  `github-action-preview-environment-controller` allow to define map of `environment => label`.
  Depending on current PR labels the action outputs a list of deploy and destroy environments.
  So it performs a `controller` role and does not limit deployment methods or tools.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  Use `github-action-preview-environment-controller` in Pull Request triggered pipeline, and use it's outputs to determinate
  what environments should be deployed and what cleaned up.

  ```yaml
    name: Pull Request
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ 'main' ]
        types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

    jobs:
      context:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Preview deployments controller
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-preview-environment-controller@main
            id: controller
            with:
              labels: ${{ toJSON(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name) }}
              open: ${{ github.event.pull_request.state == 'open' }}
              env-label: |
                preview: deploy
                qa1: deploy/qa1
                qa2: deploy/qa2
  
        outputs:
          labels_env: ${{ steps.controller.outputs.labels_env }}
          deploy_envs: ${{ steps.controller.outputs.deploy_envs }}
          destroy_envs: ${{ steps.controller.outputs.destroy_envs }}
  
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        needs: [ context ]
        steps:

        needs: [ context ]
        steps:
          - name: Destroy
            uses: example/deploy@main
            id: deploy
